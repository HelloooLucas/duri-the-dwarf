# Duri The Dwarf


## Ironhack Project #1
From March to June 2018 I attended a **Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** in Paris with [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com/en).

The program was very dense yet well structured and I learnt the following tech stack & tools:
- Angular 5
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Javascript & Typescript
- HTML 5 / CSS 3
- GitHub
- Bash CLI

Duri The Dwarf is the first of three projects I did during the bootcamp, hope you enjoy it!


## Context
The 1st project happened after two weeks of learning. At this point, we had covered:
- basic HTML & CSS manipulation
- some JS and jQuery, including arrays, objects, events and DOM manipulation

The insctructions were to create a browser-based game using a combination of technologies among the ones we studied so far.

## What is the game about?
